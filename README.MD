This is a console app written in python3. It requests html information from a given url and 'scrapes' the results for the needed information. 

Search terms are pulled from a given .csv file, the script then searches for those terms. Any headlines that have one of those terms is then exported, along with url, to an output.csv file.

This is a modification to the scraper repo.
